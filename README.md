**1. Time spent on the engineering task**  
I spent approximately 5 hours designing, implementing, and testing the .NET 8 order matching engine, ensuring strict adherence to SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and ultra-low-latency requirements.

**2. Additional features if more time were available**  
- **Stress-test benchmark**: Use BenchmarkDotNet to simulate and measure performance with over 1 million records, ensuring the library scales under heavy load.  
- **Dockerization & CI/CD**: Add a Dockerfile and GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.  
- **Enhanced observability**: Integrate Application Insights like New Relic for real-time monitoring and spike detection.

**3. Most useful feature in the latest C# version**  
I use latestt version of .net 8 which is better in improvements to performance, garbage collection

**4. Tracking down a performance issue in production**  
I create detailed logs to track processing duration from start to end
